# CNN-plus-VAE
This is an implementation of CNN plus Variational Autoencoder using tensorflow for noising unwanted complex features of an image.
Train it with dataset containing images and their target images (with unwanted features blurred). Change the input image size (default=64x64) if required. Tune the hyperparmeters of CNN and VAE according to the requirement.
